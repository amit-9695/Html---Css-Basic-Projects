            <b>Avul Pakir Jainulabdeen Abdul Kalam</b> ( 15 October 1931 â€“ 27
            July 2015) was an Indian aerospace scientist and statesman who

            and raised in Rameswaram, Tamil Nadu and studied physics and
            aerospace engineering. He spent the next four decades as a scientist
            and science administrator, mainly at the Defence Research and
            Development Organisation (DRDO) and Indian Space Research
            Organisation (ISRO) and was intimately involved in India's civilian
            space programme and military missile development efforts.He thus
            came to be known as the Missile Man of India for his work on the
            development of ballistic missile and launch vehicle technology.He
            also played a pivotal organisational, technical, and political role
            in India's Pokhran-II nuclear tests in 1998, the first since the
            original nuclear test by India in 1974.
